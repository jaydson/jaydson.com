I love to give talks! It's really rewarding to share knowledge and sometimes have the power to change people's path.  
I've doing this for over 10 years and I never feel like stopping.  
However, my profession is not being a "speaker". I'm an entrepreneur and a technology professional, more precisely, in software development.    
I don't give meaningless talks that are not part of my daily work.  
Count on me to talk about __JavaScript__, __software development__ in general, __entrepreneurship__, __internet activism__ and the __impacts of technology on the society__.

## Terms
I am not picky, but before inviting me to your event/conference/etc keep in mind the following:

ðŸ‘‰ Events in Porto Alegre or in the country side of RS should cover the cost of gas, or in some cases the bus fare, and hotel in case of need to sleep in the city  
ðŸ‘‰ My fee is negotiable and depending on the event (social focus, community, non-profit, etc.) it may be at no cost at all  
ðŸ‘‰ Extra trip expenses, such as parking at the airport, food, etc., should be covered by the event  
ðŸ‘‰ Please have the date and event venue set so I can organize things  
ðŸ‘‰ If possible, let me know the attendees profile (students, entrepreneurs, hard-core developers, etc.)  
ðŸ‘‰ If possible, let me know the estimated audience  
ðŸ‘‰ I appreciate the quality of the event I'm going to give a talk, so make sure everything is working well on the day (projector, internet, cables, sound, etc). In extreme cases, the talk can and will be canceled if the environment is not suitable  
ðŸ‘‰ In case the event going to be recorded, the video of my talk may be made available if it's non-commercial
