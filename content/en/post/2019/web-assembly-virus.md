Of course not!  

As it happens with almost all technology, vulnerabilities are always exploited.  
With WebAssembly is no different.  
In its stable version 1.0 being available in all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge), WebAssembly can already be considered a pillar of web technologies.  
A study published in June 2019 revealed that in the top one million websites, one in 600 uses WebAssembly.
