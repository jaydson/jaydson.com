title: Should we rebrand JavaScript?
---
Another video for the [BrazilJS](https://www.youtube.com/user/BrazilJS) channel.  
Mocha, LiveScript, #JavaScript, #JS, JScript, ActionScript, #ECMAScript, ES5, ES6, ES2019, # ES2020, ES8.  
It's an alphabet soup. Should we rename the JavaScript?  
In this video, I cover the topic that was discussed in an article and a podcast episode.  
In addition I talked a little about the history of JavaScript and also bring arguments for both ideas of renaming JavaScript and leaving it as it is.
