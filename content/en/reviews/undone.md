Amazon Prime shows are surprising me a lot.  
Today I bring a review of the last show I binge-watched: [Undone](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8101850/).  
The synopsis is as follows:  

> A woman discovers she has a new relationship with time after surviving a car accident that almost killed her  

The show was created by [Kate Purdy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Purdy) and [Raphael Bob-Waksberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael_Bob-Waksberg).  
Raphael is the creator of one of my favorite shows, [BoJack Horseman](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3398228/) and Kate also worked on the series as a writer.  
For those who followed BoJack, some similarities are notable, but I won't say much to avoid getting into spoilers.  

Undone is an animated series, however, with a huge differential, the show was recorded with real actors and recreated with an incredible and artistic work over the filming.  
Speaking of artistic, what an incredible job. Seriously, it makes you want to see it again just to contemplate the wonder of this animation.  
Follow the trailer below:

Undone has one season, released in 2019 and has eight episodes that pass in a snap.  
Just like the protagonist in the animation, I particularly had a different experience over time watching all episodes üòä  
Already looking forward to the next season!

Don't read on if you haven't seen the series yet.  

Undone is classified as an animation, drama and fantasy show, but what caught my attention and connected me the most was the sci-fi theme.  
The show mixes well all elements including sci-fi and indigenous beliefs.  
There is even a connection between shamanism, physics and time travel. What a trip!  
The travel scenes in parallel universes are incredible, and here we see that the animation is not there just as a simple animation. The effects work very well.  
As much as the show doesn't have real actors, we have the notion of truth because the animation takes you to that universe.  
Undone also mixes the story with schizophrenia, leaving it open if all that was just a person with the disease, including leaving us with no answer at the end, which I think is great!  
Kate Purdy's grandmother, had schizophrenia and that was one of Kate's inspirations not only for Undone, but also for Bojack, where she wrote the episode Time's Arrow (a great episode BTW).  

Below you'll findo a video with one of the show directors, [Hisko Hulsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hisko_Hulsing), explaining the whole process of creation and animation.  
For those who saw the documentary [Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Cobain:_Montage_of_Heck), you will notice a similarity in the animation.  
Hisko also worked on the documentary and it was precisely for this work that he was called to make Undone.
