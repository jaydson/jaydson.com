__Jaydson Gomes__ has been active in the technology world since the early 2000s.  
Before that, his contact with computers was possible only when he visited his cousins, who already had access to technology.  
Only around the age of 16 or 17 he had his first computer, an overclocked [AMD K6 II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_K6-2) 500Mhz.  

His first interaction with technology was at his first job at a friend's computer store, where he learned how to assemble and fix computers.  
With this first experience came the willing to learn about software development.  

He began his studies with his cousin [Felipe Nascimento](https://felipenmoura.com/) (currently business associate), learning basically how to unveil web pages, inspecting the source code (one of the advantages of the open web).  
He started a technical computer course where he learned the basis of everything: __Algorithms and Programming Logic__.  
After two semesters, he went for college and studied __Systems Analysis and Development__.  

Jaydson worked in small and large companies, agencies and startups, never losing touch with developer communities, which shaped his entrepreneurial style.  

Jaydson is currently a software developer and entrepreneur.  
He cofounded __[On2](https://on2.dev)__, a bleeding edge software development company, along with [Felipe Nascimento](https://felipenmoura.com/) and [Cesar Paz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cesarpazdex/).  
Jaydson also cofounded __[BrazilJS](https://braziljs.org/)__, a content platform focused on the developer communities in Brazil.  
At On2 he acts as a developer, business analyst and team manager.  
At BrazilJS he organises â€‹__[BrazilJS Conf](https://braziljs.org/conf)__, which is one of the world's largest __JavaScript__ conferences, editor of the **BrazilJS Weekly** Newsletter and host of [**BrazilJS Weekly on YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg2lQYZDBwOQDXKxy9yeqXG5njHbSHFFD).  
Jaydson is also author and editor at [**BrazilJS.org**](https://braziljs.org/blog) and writes on his [**personal blog**](https://jaydson.com).  

He is an open source enthusiast and has given several talks in Brazil and Latin America throughout his career, most often talking about __JavaScript__, __web technologies__ and __market__.  

In recent years, he has devoted his studies to the impacts of technology on society and has been seeking solutions to save on the Internet.
